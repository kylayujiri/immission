# immission

this repository is for immission's website and related files.

immission is inviting the omitted. creating art centered around the people whose stories are often left untold, overshadowed, or not given the acknowledgement they deserve. we are a small, independent group of creators who want to see new and unexplored ideas come to life by working collaboratively.
